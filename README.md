# Bubblesort Visualization

A simple visualization of the sorting algorithm "Bubblesort". This project was created with the intention of improving my skills in C++ and Raylib.

You might not find this program very useful, but incase you want to try it out, here is the instructions:


```
git clone https://github.com/CribbeDEV/bsort-visualization/tree/main
cd bsort-visualization
cmake .
cmake --build .
./bsort
```

You can define the size of the dataset you want sorted:
`./bsort <amount>`

## Dependencies
Raylib
